## Instruction & Demo


## Lab


### Prerequisites

 * [Vagrant 1.5.0+](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.5.0) - I'm pretty sure you'll need the latest version
 * [VirtualBox 4.2.16](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or VMWare Fusion 5
    * If you want to use VMWare Fusion you will also need the vagrant-vmware-fusion plugin for vagrant (which is not free). You also want the latest version (at least 2.1.0). If you already have this installed, you can upgrade simply by calling `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-fusion`.
 * Vagrant-Windows 1.3.2 - `vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows --plugin-version 1.3.2`.
 * At least 50GB free on the host box.

### Setup

 1. Install/upgrade Vagrant to 1.3.5+.
 1. Install/upgrade VirtualBox/VMWare to versions listed above.
 1. Install/upgrade required plugins for vagrant (if using VMWare you will need the non-free vagrant-vmware-fusion or equivalent).
 1. Install/upgrade vagrant-windows vagrant plugin. Open terminal/command line and type `vagrant plugin install vagrant-windows`
 1. Take a look at this gist that might be helpful in determining commands to call for setup: [Install Vagrant Windows Environment](https://gist.github.com/ferventcoder/6251225)
