## Licensing

Paul Stack and Rob Reynolds grant you a royalty free license to share what you learn in the workshop with everyone you meet. In fact please share what you learn here. Learning is infectious; it gets in your bones and makes the world a better place. Eyes light up when folks see something like Vagrant and all of the things that it can help solve!
